### üéØ Streamlined Quarto Project Creation

Initialize a comprehensive Quarto project with a single command:

```r
froggeR::quarto_project(
  name = 'my_new_project',
  custom_yaml = TRUE  # Use custom YAML from _variables.yml
)
```

This creates:
* A Quarto document with custom YAML
* A comprehensive `.gitignore`
* A structured `README.md`
* A reusable `_variables.yml`
* A `custom.scss` style sheet template
* An RStudio project file (`.Rproj`)

### üîÑ Centralized Settings Management

Maintain consistent metadata across your documents:

```r
froggeR::froggeR_settings()
```

Interactively create or update metadata that is reusable across Quarto projects & 
documents with:
* Author details
* Contact information
* Affiliations
* Project metadata
* Document preferences

### üìù Templated Quarto Documents

Generate new Quarto documents with pre-formatted headers:

```r
froggeR::write_quarto(
  filename = 'frogs',
  custom_yaml = TRUE  # Use variables from _variables.yml
)
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Git Protection

Set up a comprehensive `.gitignore` for R projects:

```r
froggeR::write_ignore()
```

Automatically excludes:
* R data files (`.RData`, `.rda`, `.rds`)
* Common data formats (CSV, Excel, text files)
* Sensitive information

### üåü Custom Styling Made Easy

Generate a SCSS template for custom document styling:

```r
froggeR::write_scss()
```

Provides a formatted stylesheet with:
* SCSS defaults
* SCSS mixins
* SCSS rules

Customize your document's appearance by uncommenting desired styles.

### üìö Automated Project Documentation

Generate a structured README for your project:

```r
froggeR::write_readme()
```

Includes sections for:
* Project overview
* Setup instructions
* File and directory explanations
* Contribution guidelines
