**Project Description**:

This project was started on October 18, 2024 and is intended for the University of Miami
Feaster & Balise Lab team's internal use. Some of the functions can be used outside of UM
at the developer's discretion.

These are helper functions to enhance workflows. Some functions are wrapper functions for
existing packages, while others are custom.

*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!* Check back for more updates

**NOTE**: This project may require a name change as there is currently a CRAN package
named "yum". If this is to be released publicly, the name *will* be changing.
