## Introduction

`froggeR` streamlines Quarto workflows by providing a robust, user-friendly framework for project setup and document creation. This vignette demonstrates how `froggeR` can enhance your productivity while maintaining project consistency.

```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("kyleGrealis/froggeR")
```

----

## Core Features

Project setup often involves repetitive tasks that can impede your analysis workflow. `froggeR` addresses this by providing:

* Automated project initialization with [`quarto_project()`](https://kylegrealis.github.io/froggeR/reference/quarto_project.html)
* Configurable document templates via [`write_quarto()`](https://kylegrealis.github.io/froggeR/reference/write_quarto.html)
* Reusable project configurations through [`froggeR_settings()`](https://kylegrealis.github.io/froggeR/reference/froggeR_settings.html)
* Consistent styling with [`write_scss()`](https://kylegrealis.github.io/froggeR/reference/write_scss.html)
* Enhanced version control setup

----

## Quick Start Guide

Create a new Quarto project with a single command:

```r
froggeR::quarto_project(name = "frogs")
```

This command initializes a complete project structure with all necessary components:

### Project Components

1. **Quarto Document** (`frogs.qmd`)
    * Pre-configured YAML header
    * Professional styling
    * Ready for immediate use

2. **Style Sheet** (`custom.scss`)
    * Modern design elements
    * Customizable components
    * Clear documentation

3. **Project Configuration**
    * `.Rproj` for RStudio integration
    * `_variables.yml` for consistent metadata
    * `.gitignore` for secure version control

See `vignette("customizing-quarto", package = "froggeR")` for more detailed configuration options.

----

## Customization

### Document Settings

Manage your document settings with the interactive configuration tool (see `?froggeR_settings` for all options):

```r
# Configure your settings
froggeR::froggeR_settings()

# Create a new document using your settings
froggeR::write_quarto(
  filename = "analysis",
  custom_yaml = TRUE  # Use your configured settings
)
```

### Visual Styling

Customize your document appearance with SCSS:

```r
froggeR::write_scss(name = "custom")
froggeR::write_notes()
froggeR::write_readme()
```

This creates a `custom.scss` file with commented-out examples. Uncomment and modify these to customize your document's appearance. For more information on Quarto styling, refer to:

- [Quarto HTML Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)
- [Customizing Quarto Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#customizing-themes)

----

## Advanced Usage

### Project Documentation

Generate comprehensive project documentation:

```r
# Create structured README
froggeR::write_readme()
```

This creates:

* A detailed README.md
* Progress tracking notes
* Project structure documentation

----

## Best Practices

For optimal results with `froggeR`:

1. **Project Organization**
    * Use consistent naming conventions
    * Maintain clear directory structure
    * Document project changes

2. **Version Control**
    * Review `.gitignore` settings
    * Update progress notes regularly
    * Maintain README documentation

3. **Styling**
    * Test SCSS changes before implementation
    * Document custom styling decisions
    * Use variables for consistency

----

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues

1. **Q: My YAML isn't rendering correctly in the Quarto document.**

   A: Ensure that your `_variables.yml` file is properly formatted. Check for any extra spaces or incorrect indentation.

2. **Q: The SCSS styles aren't applying to my document.**

   A: Make sure the SCSS file is properly linked in your YAML header. Remember, the order of the styles sheets matters. During the initialization of `froggeR::write_quarto(custom_yaml = TRUE)`, the `custom.scss` will override anything set in the `default` styling. The same applies if another SCSS sheet is added -- it will override all SCSS files listed above it. Check the console for any error messages during rendering.

3. **Q: I'm getting an error when trying to create a new project.**

   A: Ensure you have the latest version of froggeR and Quarto installed. Also, check if you have write permissions in the target directory.

### Tips for Smoother Projects

- Always review the generated files after project creation to ensure everything is set up as expected.
- When customizing SCSS, make small changes and render frequently to see the effects.
- Keep your froggeR settings up-to-date, especially when working across multiple projects.
