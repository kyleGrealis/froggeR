## The Problem: Repetitive Metadata Entry

Have you ever found yourself typing the same author information into every new Quarto project? Or copying and pasting your ORCID, email, and affiliations from one `_variables.yml` file to another?

You're not alone. This repetitive work is tedious, error-prone, and takes time away from your actual research or analysis.

## The Solution: Global Configuration

froggeR introduces a simple but powerful concept: **configure your metadata once, use it everywhere**.

With `settings()` and `brand_settings()`, you can:

- Store your author information globally on your system
- Reuse it automatically in every new froggeR project
- Override with project-specific settings when needed
- Never type your ORCID again (unless you want to)

## How It Works

froggeR uses two storage locations for your configuration:

1. **Project-level**: Stored in your current project directory
   - `_variables.yml` for author metadata
   - `_brand.yml` for branding configuration

2. **Global**: Stored in your system's configuration directory
   - Automatically reused in all new froggeR projects
   - Platform-specific location (managed by the `rappdirs` package)
   - Overridden by project-level settings if they exist

## Key Takeaways

1. **Configure once**: Use `settings()` and `brand_settings()` to set up your global configuration
2. **Use everywhere**: All new froggeR projects automatically include your settings
3. **Override flexibly**: Project-level settings take precedence when you need customization
4. **View anytime**: Check your current configuration at any time
5. **Save time**: Eliminate repetitive metadata entry from your workflow
