## Welcome to froggeR! 🐸

`froggeR` streamlines your Quarto workflow by automating project setup and standardizing document creation. Let's explore how it can enhance your productivity!

```r
# Install the development version
devtools::install_github("kyleGrealis/froggeR")
```

## Why Use froggeR?

Project setup often requires repetitive tasks that can slow down your analysis workflow. `froggeR` addresses this by providing:

- Automated project initialization
- Standardized document templates
- Consistent styling
- Version control setup
- Reusable configurations


## Quick Start

Let's create a new Quarto project with all the ribbit-ing features you need:

```r
library(froggeR)

# Create a new project with default settings
quarto_project("my_analysis")
```

That's it! 🎉 Your new project includes all necessary files and configurations.

- A structured Quarto document
- Custom SCSS styling
- Git ignore settings
- README template
- And more!

## What's included?

When you create a project with `froggeR`, you get:

1. **Quarto Document** (`my_analysis.qmd`):

   - Pre-configured YAML header
   - Professional styling
   - Ready for immediate use

2. **Style Sheet** (`custom.scss`):

   - Clean, modern styling
   - Customizable design elements
   - Simplified CSS workflow

3. **Project Config** (`.Rproj`):

   - Consistent project settings
   - RStudio integration
   - Reproducible environment

4. **Git Ready** (`.gitignore`):

   - Smart defaults for R projects
   - Clean repository management
   - Optimized for data science and protecting PHI

## Customizing Your Project

Make the project yours with easy customization options:

### Custom YAML Variables

Configure reusable document headers with your information. This is safely stored in your `.Rprofile` and retrieved during project initialization to consistently include:

- Author name
- Contact information
- Website links

```r
# Create or modify _variables.yml
write_variables()  # Interactive prompts for your info
```

### Custom Styling

```r
# Add your own SCSS styles
write_scss(name = "my_styles")
```

## Advanced Features

Take your Quarto projects further with advanced functionality:

1. **Multiple Documents**:
```r
# Create additional Quarto docs in your project
write_quarto(
  filename = "analysis_part2",
  path = "my_analysis"
)
```

2. **Data Management**:

Let's say your `data/` directory contains multiple file types (`.rda`, `.Rdata`, & `.csv`). Load them all into your environment with a single command:
```r
# Loads all supported file types from the specified directory
load_data("project/data/")
```

Note: Supported file types include common R data formats and plain text files.

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble? Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **Q: My styles aren't applying!**  
  A: Verify SCSS file reference in YAML header

- **Q: Where's my _variables.yml?**  
  A: Execute `write_variables()` in your project directory

## Summary

`froggeR` empowers you to create professional, consistent Quarto projects efficiently. Key benefits:

- Streamlined project organization
- Consistent styling
- Automated setup
- Enhanced productivity
