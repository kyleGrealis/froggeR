## Welcome to the Lily Pad! 🐸

Hey there! I'm Teek, and I'll be your amphibian guide to creating awesome Quarto projects. Let's hop right in!

## Why Use froggeR?

Ever felt like project setup was taking longer than the actual analysis? Been there! That's why we created `froggeR` - to help you leap over those pesky setup hurdles and get straight to the good stuff.

## Quick Start

Let's create a new Quarto project with all the ribbit-ing features you need:

```r
library(froggeR)

# Create a new project with default settings
quarto_project("my_analysis")
```

Boom! 🎉 Just like that, you've got:

- A structured Quarto document
- Custom SCSS styling
- Git ignore settings
- README template
- And more!

## What's in Your New Pad?

When you create a project with `froggeR`, here's what you get (no flies included):

1. **Quarto Document** (`my_analysis.qmd`):

   - Pre-configured YAML header
   - Clean, professional styling
   - Ready for your brilliant analysis!

2. **Style Sheet** (`custom.scss`):

   - Make your documents look crisp
   - Easy to customize
   - No CSS expertise required

3. **Project Config** (`.Rproj`):

   - Consistent project settings
   - Works smoothly with RStudio
   - No more "but it works on my machine"!

4. **Git Ready** (`.gitignore`):

   - Smart defaults for R projects
   - Keeps your repository clean
   - No accidental file commits

## Customizing Your Project

Want to make it your own? No problem! Here's how to customize different aspects:

### Custom YAML Variables

Add the ability to re-use the same Quarto header and input:

- your name
- your email address
- add a website link
- add tags to the project for publication
- a custom name for Table of Contents

```r
# Create or modify _variables.yml
write_variables()  # Interactive prompts for your info
```

### Custom Styling

```r
# Add your own SCSS styles
write_scss(name = "my_styles")
```

## Advanced Development

Ready to take your Quarto game to the next level? Here are some pro tips:

1. **Multiple Documents**:
```r
# Create additional Quarto docs in your project
write_quarto(
  filename = "analysis_part2",
  path = "my_analysis"
)
```

2. **Load all data in one shot**:
```r
# Read multiple data types from one directory
load_data("project/data/")
```

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble? Here are some common hiccups and how to fix them:

- **Q: My styles aren't applying!**  
  A: Make sure your SCSS file is referenced in your YAML header

- **Q: Where's my _variables.yml?**  
  A: Run `write_variables()` in your project directory

## Wrap Up

That's it! You're ready to create beautiful, consistent Quarto projects faster than a frog can catch a fly. 

Remember:

- Keep your projects organized
- Style consistently
- Have fun with your analysis!
