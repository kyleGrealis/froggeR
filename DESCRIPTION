Description: Streamlines Quarto workflows by providing tools for consistent project 
    setup and documentation. Enables reusability through custom YAML variables, 
    automated project structure creation, and standardized templates. Features 
    include enhanced project initialization, templated Quarto documents, 
    comprehensive .gitignore settings, custom SCSS styling, and structured 
    documentation generation. Designed to improve efficiency and collaboration in R 
    data science projects by reducing repetitive setup tasks while maintaining 
    consistent formatting across multiple documents.
