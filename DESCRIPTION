Description: Provides an opinionated project scaffold for R and 'Quarto' analysis work, enforcing a consistent directory layout with scripts in R/, .qmd files in pages/, and assets in www/. The primary entry point, init(), downloads the latest template from a companion GitHub repository so that project structure evolves independently of package releases. Supports persistent author metadata and 'Quarto' brand configuration that carry across projects automatically.
