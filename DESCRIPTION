Description: Streamlines 'Quarto' workflows by providing tools for consistent project setup and documentation. Enables reusability through custom YAML variables, automated project structure creation, and standardized templates. Features include enhanced project initialization, templated 'Quarto' documents, comprehensive .gitignore settings, custom SCSS styling, and structured documentation generation. Designed to improve efficiency and collaboration in R data science projects by reducing repetitive setup tasks while maintaining consistent formatting across multiple documents. There are many valuable resources providing in-depth explanations of customizing 'Quarto' templates and theme styling by the Posit team: <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#customizing-themes> & <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html>, and at the Bootstrap community's GitHub at <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss>.
