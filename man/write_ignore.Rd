A .gitignore file with enhanced security rules. The file includes:

}
}
\description{
This function creates or updates a .gitignore file with enhanced security measures
designed to help prevent accidental data leaks. The template includes comprehensive
rules for common data file types and sensitive information.
}
\details{
If a .gitignore file already exists, the user will be prompted before any
overwriting occurs. The template provides substantial security enhancements
over basic .gitignore files.

WARNING: Always consult your organization's data security team before using git
with any sensitive or protected health information (PHI). This template helps
prevent accidental data exposure but should not be considered a complete
security solution.
