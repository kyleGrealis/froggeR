# froggeR 0.4.1

## Enhancements
* 2 new Quarto brand YAML functions have been added: `write_brand()` & `save_brand()`. These functions allow users to add project `_brand.yml` file and save the current `_brand.yml` to where your machine stores configuration files.
* Modified SCSS template placeholders -- some of these are now easier to manage in the `_brand.yml` file. Added tweaks for ORCID logo issue when rendering with branding on Windows.
* Revised Quarto template YAML -- this seems to be a contant work in progress. Weighing the value of including defaults versus a more minimalistic approach.
* Removed creation of `.Rproj` file in `quarto_project()`.

## Bug Fixes
* Corrected logic flow in `write_variables()` that caused unintentional stoppage.

# froggeR 0.4.0

## Enhancements
* NEW: `save_variables()` is a new function to store the current project-level `_variables.yml` to the system configuration file path. It offers to overwrite if the system config exists.
* Simplified Quarto templates by removing unnecessary commenting throughout the YAML.
* Added section for including multiple authors in Quarto YAML files.
* Simplified README in favor of a more lightweight template.

## Bug Fixes
* Corrected indentation error for `affiliations` in the standard, non-custom Quarto template. Created rendering error.

## Documentation
* `save_variables()` documentation added to README

## Internal Changes
* Fixed tests for `write_notes()` and `write_readme()` to reflect updated content.

# froggeR 0.3.0

## Enhancements
* The `settings()` function replaces `froggeR_settings` and provides a menu-driven interface. User's can now check, view, & get instructions to use Quarto metadata within and across projects. Learn how to apply user-specific metadata from the global config file, or store local project metadata for reuse on future froggeR Quarto projects.
* The suite of `write_*` functions open the created files for immediate viewing & editing (in interactive sessions).
* Revised console feedback so users are always informed about how froggeR is helping streamline your project.

## Bug Fixes 
* *None*

## Documentation
* Fixed roxygen documentation for `@examples` by using `tempdir()` when executing functions.
* Used `@inheretParams` across supplemental functions (README, notes, ignore, SCSS, variables).

## Internal Changes
* Removed abililty to change metadata from the console. Instructions are now provided and, for `write_variables()`, the config file is opened in the interactive session.
* Separated `write_readme`; now includes `write_notes` for a project-level progress notes template.
* If any document to be created from the `write_*` functions exists in the project, froggeR will now stop and provide a useful message *instead* of offering to overwrite from the console. This reduces annoying feedback & interaction and encourages the user to make deliberate decions.
